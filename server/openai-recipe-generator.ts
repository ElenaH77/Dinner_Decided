The instructions were flagged for low quality. Please return a revised set of 10-15 clearly written, detailed cooking instructions. Each step must:

- Start with a clear, specific action verb (NOT generic verbs like "prepare", "combine", "add", "cook" without context)
- Include specific quantities from the ingredients list
- Mention cooking times and temperatures where applicable (exact numbers required)
- Avoid vague phrases like "cook until done" or "combine ingredients"
- Include sensory cues (what to see, hear, smell, or feel during cooking)
- Explain specialized techniques (if any)
- Be 15-25 words long for sufficient detail
- Use proper cooking terminology

Return ONLY the instructions as a JSON array of strings where each string is a complete instruction step.
