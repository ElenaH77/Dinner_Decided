Create detailed cooking instructions for this recipe:

Recipe: ${recipe.title}

Ingredients:
${recipe.ingredients.join('\n')}

Requirements for instructions:
1. Create 10-15 detailed steps
2. Each step must start with a clear action verb (NOT "prepare", "combine", "add", "cook" alone)
3. Include specific quantities from the ingredients list
4. Include exact cooking times and temperatures 
5. Avoid vague phrases like "cook until done"
6. Include sensory cues (what to see, smell, or feel during cooking)
7. Explain any specialized techniques
8. Each step should be 15-25 words

Return ONLY the numbered instructions with no additional text.
