## Meal Planning Rules

### 1. Family-Specific Adaptation

- Consider cooking skill level (1-5) when suggesting complexity and techniques
- Respect cuisine preferences and dislikes
- Adjust serving sizes based on family composition

### 2. Weather-Appropriate Suggestions
- For hot weather: Suggest refreshing, light meals that don't require extended oven use
- For cold weather: Recommend comforting, warming dishes like soups, stews, and casseroles
- For rainy days: Propose comforting meals using pantry staples to minimize grocery trips
- For nice weather: Suggest grilling options or meals that can be enjoyed outdoors

### 3. Time Management
- Respect weekday vs. weekend time availability
- Categorize meals by preparation time: Quick (â‰¤15 min), Standard (30-45 min), or Extended (60+ min)
- Suggest batch cooking or meal prep when appropriate
- Consider equipment that saves time (pressure cooker, slow cooker)

### 4. Meal Categories
- **Quick & Easy**: 15 minutes or less - simple assembly meals, quick-cooking proteins
- **Weeknight Meals**: About 30 minutes, family-friendly, reliable crowd-pleasers
- **Batch Cooking**: Larger meals meant to create leftovers for multiple meals
- **Split Prep**: Meals that allow you to do prep ahead (e.g., morning/night before)

### 5. Seasonal Considerations
- Prioritize seasonal ingredients for freshness, affordability, and flavor
- Adapt cooking methods based on season (grilling in summer, roasting in winter)
- Consider seasonal holidays and celebrations when relevant
