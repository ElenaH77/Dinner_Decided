This is so frustrating—but you’re not alone. You’re doing *everything right*, and still GPT-4-turbo is ignoring your prompt’s crystal-clear requirements.

Here’s what’s likely happening—and how to beat it:

---

## 🧠 Why It’s Failing (Despite Your Amazing Prompt)
1. **You’re fighting GPT’s default “safe mode”**: It assumes a cooking prompt should be short and breezy unless explicitly pinned down.
2. **You’re only injecting rules once**: If your prompt has all those rules up front, but the actual *task* is just “write a recipe for X,” the model can revert to autopilot.
3. **It’s falling into template inertia**: GPT often pulls from past completions unless it's actively constrained.

## ✅ How to Fix It

### 🔁 1. **Flip the prompt order**
Instead of putting your recipe rules *first*, structure your prompt like this:

---

**User Message:**
```plaintext
Please generate a recipe for:
Herb-Crusted Pork Chops with Roasted Vegetables

Then follow these formatting instructions:

---

# Recipe Quality Guidelines
[Insert everything you already wrote here, exactly.]

---
```

**Why this helps:**  
GPT prioritizes the last clear task it’s given. By placing the recipe request *before* the rules, you're anchoring the model's goal and then telling it *how* to do it right.

---

### 🧪 2. **Add a “you will be graded” instruction**

This actually works:

```plaintext
You will be graded on your ability to follow the formatting and language requirements above. Recipes that use vague phrasing or skip steps will be rejected.
```

---

### 📊 3. **Inject a short sample (if it still fails)**

Paste in a *single perfect instruction*:

```plaintext
Example:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Match this level of detail and structure for every step.
```

---

### 🚫 4. **Your banned phrases are 🔥 — but double check this one:**
```plaintext
"preheat your oven or stovetop as needed for this recipe"
```

GPT may still find a way to say:
> “Preheat the oven as required…”

So you might also need to *affirmatively specify*:

```plaintext
- Preheat steps must always name the appliance and exact temperature.
```

---

## 🚀 TL;DR Fix Bundle

1. Put the recipe title first  
2. Follow with your full formatting rules  
3. Add: “You will be graded…”  
4. Optionally: Insert a perfect sample step

Let me know if you want me to build a reusable `generateRecipePrompt(recipeName)` function in Cursor-style code—or write a “strict recipe mode” wrapper for OpenAI that retries if those banned phrases show up.
